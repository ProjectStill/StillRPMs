Repository for stillOS essential RPMs...

This includes many internal packages including our release files, logos, default settings, and default repositories. All of these will be applied to our RPM Tree.

All of these packages were forked from the original ones used in risiOS (Precursor to this OS), which in turned were forked and modified from the original Fedora packages.
